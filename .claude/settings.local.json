The mail server died.\"\n\nWere being extracted as TWO items instead of ONE:\n- Before: \"Fix UAT issue\" + \"Fix mail server\"\n- After: \"Fix the mail server issue on UAT environment\"\n\nThe AI now better understands that multiple sentences can describe\nthe same underlying task and should be combined.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
